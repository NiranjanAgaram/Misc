Adding html code in Jekyll site

Create a folder with the name _includes/ in the DocumentRoot of your project, then, create an HTML file inside, for example "mycomponent.html" and call it in your post with something like this:

{% include mycomponent.html %}

This file can have any HTML/CSS/JS you want.
